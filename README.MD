# Instructions

## SQL

In the `sql` directory, you will find a `structure.sql` file containing a base sql schema.

This is the database structure we will use for this exercice.

Your first task is to optimize this schema for performance and consistency keeping in mind that:
* A category can contain 0 to n assets
* An asset can be in 0 to n categories
* Categories can't have the same id
* Assets can't have the same id
* Assets can't have the same name
* Categories can't have the same name
* Since it's a REST API, both assets and categories will be queried using their ids.

As soon as you'll be done with those optimizations, import your schema in a local database.

You can now import some test data from the `data.sql` file.

## Java

We need you to create a java web service serving REST requests.

In the `java` directory, you'll find a sample Spring Application pre-configured with hibernate and postgresql 
(feel free to update the configuration if needed).

Starting it will start a server listening on local port `8080`. Check that it's working prior to start working on this part.

What we want you to implement is an endpoint listening on `GET /category` and that will return a list of all known categories, 
using the DTOs present in the `tv.alphanetworks.exo.dto` package. Feel free to ignore the `downloads` field for now.

Please be cautionous while implementing this endpoint and pay attention to the good practices when it comes to Spring architectures 
(DTOs, DAOs, services, models, controllers, ...) a default package structure is provided but feel free to change it.

## BONUS PHP

We need you to create a PHP web service serving REST requests.

endpoint: `GET /asset/{assedId}/downloads`. Return a single random integer

Hint: [Flight](http://flightphp.com/) is a good & super-light framework but use whatever you want

## Mix them for more fun !

Remember the `downloads` field in the Java `Asset` ? We now want you to fill it using the PHP service you just created.

This should be done Java side between the loading of the data from the database and the response to the request. 
Feel free to implement this using the technology of your choice and wherever you want in your application. 
(Hint: Spring `RestTemplate` is a good tool).

## Testing

Do you know what unit tests are ? If so, write some... (Only for Java)
